# alx-low_level_programming

## 0x00-hello_world
- compiling c programs using gcc
- Writing programs in betty style
- Using printf, puts and write
- using stdio.h

## 0x01-variables_if_else_while
- Controll structures in c
- loops in c.

## 0x02-functions_nested_loops
- Nested loops
- Functions : ``` declaration ``` , ``` definition ```.
- Function prototypes.
- Scope of variables.

## 0x03-debugging
``` Debugging ```
- Finding and resolving bugs.

## 0x04-more_functions_nested_loops
- Nested loops
- Functions and prototypes.

## 0x05-pointers_arrays_strings
- Pointers
- Arrays
- Strings

## 0x06-pointers_arrays_strings
- More pointers arrays an strings.

## 0x07-pointers_arrays_strings
- Even more pointers, arrays and strings.

## 0x08-recursion
- Recursion is where the solution to a problem depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem.
- Working with recursive functions.

## 0x09-static_libraries
- Creating and using Static Libraries in C.

## 0x0A-argc_argv
- argc is Argument count.
- argv is Argument vector.
- passing argc and argv to main.

## 0x0B-malloc_free
- ``` malloc ``` function allocates a specific number of bytes in memory and returns a pointer to the allocated memory.
- ``` free ``` function frees up memory allocated.
> This project entails some ways in whihc malloc and free can be used in C.

## 0x0C-more_malloc_free
> This project entails more ways in which malloc can be used.

## 0x0D-preprocessor
> Thr preprocessor removes comments and includes header files in source code before compilation begins. It also replaces macro names with code.
> This project will inlcude some of the ways in which macros are effective in C.

## 0x0E-structures_typedef
> Structures in C are user defined datatypes that can hold elements of different datatypes.
> Typedef is used to declare elements of a cetain datatype from an existing datatype. 
> - This project outlines the different uses of structures and typedef.

## 0x0F-function_pointers
> Like normal pointers, there exists pointers that point to code rather than data these are function pointers.
> - This project shows some of the ways we can use function pointers.

## 0x10-variadic_functions
> A variadic function is a function that takes a  variable number of arguments whenever its called.
> - This project outlines different ways in which variadic functions can be used.

## 0x12-singly_linked_lists
> A linked list is a naturally recursive data structure.
> - This project outlines some of the ways in which linked lists can be used.

## 0x13-more_singly_linked_lists
> - This project contains more ways of using linked lists.

## 0x14-bit_manipulation
> Bit manipulation is the act of algorithmically manipulating bits or other pieces of data
shorter than a byte. 
> - C language is very efficient in manpulating bits.
> - This project shows different ways of manipulating bits in C.

## 0x15-file_io
> Dealing with system calls provided by the kernel.

## 0x17-doubly_linked_lists

> Doubly linked list si different from the singly linked list such that each node has an extra pointer to the previous node.
- In this project, different operatiosn on the doubly linked list are demonstrated.
